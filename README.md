# MERN_APP
My First Project based on MERN Stack.Intially it went difficult to work on react routing but building this project made me understand the concept of Routing.
Initially I struggled with forms in React.This project made me confident about retriving and posting the data from the forms to the server
THE STACK
1)Mongodb as a database (MongoDB Compass is a great way to look through your database)
2)Express.js used for Server side 
3)React (The Frontend Part)
4)Node.js
